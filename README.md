CNS Assignment 3 – Web App

This project is a web-based application developed as part of CNS Assignment 3.
It uses Streamlit to create an interactive UI, PyCryptodome and PQCrypto for cryptographic operations, and Pyngrok to expose the app to the internet.

🚀 Features

Interactive web app built with Streamlit
Supports cryptographic algorithms (classical + post-quantum)
Secure and user-friendly interface
Ngrok integration for remote access

📦 Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
Install dependencies using:
pip install streamlit pyngrok pycryptodome pqcrypto

▶️ Running the App
Clone or download this repository
Open the notebook or extract the code into a Python script (app.py)

Run Streamlit:
streamlit run app.py
If running in Colab/Jupyter, Ngrok will provide a public URL
